# Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning-through-SQL

Welcome to the Nashville Housing Data Cleanup repository! This project provides an SQL script designed to clean and preprocess a Nashville housing dataset. The script is intended to handle common data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and standardizing data formats to prepare the dataset for further analysis.
